# 1. x = 2 => 2; why?

# 2. puts x = 2 => nil; printing but not returning

# 3. p name = "Joe" => "Joe"; prints and returns

# 4. four = "four" => "four"; same as 1

# 5. print something = "nothing" => nil; printing but not returning

# Number 2 puts the returned value of x = 2, so number 1 needs to return 2

# print does not include a new line character
